check clang and corresponding directory 
echo | clang -E -x c++ - -v


clang++ -Iinclude src/main_sample.cpp src/module.cpp -o build/my_program


Organize code into src/ for source files 
and include/ for header files.

Use relative paths (../include/module.h) 
to include header files from other directories.

Compile the project using a Makefile or manually using g++ with 
-I to specify the include directory.

-Iinclude: This option tells the compiler where to find additional header files.
 In this case, -Iinclude means that any 
 #include directives in your code that reference files in the 
 include/ directory will work (e.g., #include "module.h")

 -o build/my_program
 created in the build/ directory and named my_program

 The compiler will look in the src/ directory for these files
